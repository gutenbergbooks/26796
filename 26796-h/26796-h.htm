<h2>NO SECT IN HEAVEN.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Talking</span> of sects till late one eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the various doctrines the saints believe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That night I stood in a troubled dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the side of a darkly flowing stream.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And a "Churchman" down to the river came:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I heard a strange voice call his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Good father, stop; when you cross this tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must leave your robes on the other side."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><span class="i0">But the aged father did not mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his long gown floated out behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As down to the stream his way he took,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pale hands clasping a gilt-edged book.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I'm bound for heaven, and when I'm there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall want my book of Common Prayer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though I put on a starry crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should feel quite lost without my gown."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><span class="i0">Then he fixed his eye on the shining track,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his gown was heavy, and held him back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the poor old father tried in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A single step in the flood to gain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I saw him again on the other side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his silk gown floated on the tide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no one asked in that blissful spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether he belonged to "<i>the</i> Church" or not.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span><span class="i0">Then down to the river a Quaker strayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His dress of a sober hue was made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My coat and hat must be all of gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot go any other way."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he buttoned his coat straight up to his chin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And staidly, solemnly, waded in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his broad-brimmed hat he pulled down tight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over his forehead, so cold and white.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span><span class="i0">But a strong wind carried away his hat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment he silently sighed over that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, as he gazed to the farther shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coat slipped off, and was seen no more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As he entered heaven, his suit of gray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went quietly sailing&mdash;away&mdash;away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none of the angels questioned him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the width of his beaver's brim.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><span class="i0">Next came Dr. Watts, with a bundle of Psalms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tied nicely up in his aged arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hymns as many, a very wise thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the people in heaven, "all round," might sing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But I thought that he heaved an anxious sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he saw that the river ran broad and high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked rather surprised as, one by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Psalms and Hymns in the wave went down.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><span class="i0">And after him, with his MSS.,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came Wesley, the pattern of godliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he cried, "Dear me, what shall I do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water has soaked them through and through."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And there on the river, far and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away they went down the swollen tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the saint astonished, passed through alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without his manuscripts, up to the throne.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><span class="i0">Then, gravely walking, two saints by name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the stream together came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as they stopped at the river's brink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw one saint from the other shrink.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sprinkled or plunged, may I ask you, friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How you attained to life's great end?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Thus</i>, with a few drops on my brow."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But <i>I</i> have been dipped, as you'll see me now.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span><span class="i0">"And I really think it will hardly do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I'm 'close communion,' to cross with you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You're bound, I know, to the realms of bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you must go that way, and I'll go this."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then straightway plunging with all his might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away to the left&mdash;his friend at the right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apart they went from this world of sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at last together they entered in.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span><span class="i0">And now, when the river was rolling on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Presbyterian church went down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of women there seemed an innumerable throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the men I could count as they passed along.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And concerning the road they could never agree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>old</i> or the <i>new</i> way, which it could be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever a moment paused to think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That both would lead to the river's brink.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><span class="i0">And a sound of murmuring long and loud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came ever up from the moving crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You're in the old way, and I'm in the new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is the false, and this is the true,"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, "I'm in the old way, and you're in the new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That</i> is the false, and <i>this</i> is the true."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the <i>brethren</i> only seemed to speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Modest the sisters walked, and meek,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><span class="i0">And if ever one of then chanced to say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What troubles she met with on the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How she longed to pass to the other side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor feared to cross over the swelling tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A voice arose from the brethren then:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Let no one speak but the 'holy men;'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For have ye not heard the words of Paul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Oh, let the women keep silence all?'"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span><span class="i0">I watched them long in my curious dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they stood by the borders of the stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, just as I thought, the two ways met,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all the brethren were talking yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would talk on, till the heaving tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carried them over, side by side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Side by side, for the way was one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The toilsome journey of life was done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And priest and Quaker, and all who died,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><span class="i0">Came out alike on the other side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No forms, or crosses, or books had they,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No gowns of silk, or suits of gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No creeds to guide them, or MSS.,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all had put on Christ's righteousness.<br /></span>
